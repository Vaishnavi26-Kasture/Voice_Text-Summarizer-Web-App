## ðŸŽ¤ Voice Summarizer App
This is a Streamlit-based web application that records voice input, transcribes it to text, and then summarizes the transcribed content using a pre-trained transformer model (facebook/bart-large-cnn). It also stores all data in a local SQLite database and allows users to download the results as a CSV file.
